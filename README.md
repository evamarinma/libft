## :pushpin: My first C library

### :open_book: Introduction
This was my first C approach in 42. Is a list of functions, most of them are already built-in through C libraries, but the main goal of this project was not getting the functions done, but deeply understanding how they worked by building them by myself. We use calloc everyday, but did you know how it actually works? Take a look through this code!

> *If you're a 42 student: 42 projects must be CODED by yourself. Do not copy this project into yours. You will learn nothing by doing that. Exams are completed without Internet connection; you're alone with your IDE. The porpuse of these repositories is to show what we do at 42 and, yes, if you're stucked at some point, learn something new, but give peer-to-peer a chance first* 😉.


### :open_file_folder: Makefile
Here are some commands available to compile the code for this project.
```bash
# Compile whole project
make

# Erase .o files
make clean

# Erase .o files and executable
make fclean

# Re-compiles project
make re
```

### :point_up::nerd_face: Tips
* Feel free to look for more about each function in the Linux manual with `man <function-name>` in your terminal!
* Don't know what a certain parameter does? Feeling curious about a library used by your function? Internet is wide, look for it!
* Can't you find some information on blogs? Ask your favourite AI about it! Use it as a searching index! **DO NOT** ask them to do your job, but take advantage and use it as an ally to learn deeper! *Keep in mind AI might be wrong about somethings, contrast their info with blogs/posts/etc*
